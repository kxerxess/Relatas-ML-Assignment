      " We are writing from GHF regarding the previous discussions that we had about the business proposal that your company sent us. We are happy to let you know that GHF accepted your business proposal. Thank you for offering us the opportunity of working with you. We are looking forward to work with your company.I had asked you to send the progress on the project by the end of last week but I still haven't got it. Do send us the report asap. We will not be able to move forward with the deal unless we get it verified by our CEO. I wish to commend your receptionist, Jany Dan, for the way she handled our problem yesterday. She was courteous and friendly as she made half a dozen telephone calls on my behalf, not giving up until she had traced the missing shipment. Ms. Dan is an asset to your organization and is part of the reason I look forward to doing business with you again in the future.I need to cancel the appointment I made to you on January 29, at 9:00 a.m.Congratulations! Your hard work has paid off! After carefully reviewing your performance reports, the board has voted unanimously to promote you to the position of office manager. This promotion will entitle you to a 10% salary increase and an office in the management suite. We feel that you will do a fine job and wish you every success in this new position.It gives me immense pleasure to write to you with regard to the offer of marketing relationship with your company.

We hope to have a mutually beneficial business relationship with your company. Looking forward to a positive reply from your end.The business deal has been closed successfullyThank you for the computer benchmarks produced by Thorogood Computer Associates; they really are excellent! Thank you once again for your contribution to the industry.I am pleased we will be able to discuss the management plan. I will meet you at the Park Plaza at 12:00 p.m. Thursday. I believe this meeting will help us speed up the project.I have considered it carefully and must decline the offer because the position will require too much travel.I am not sure if we need the product right nowRegrettably, Dox does not publish unsolicited material. We plan our publication months in advance and make topic assignments to the various free-lance and in-house writers in our data base. If you wish to be considered for an assignment in the future, please submit a cover letter and three writing samples. If you meet our criteria, we will add you to our data base.As anticipated, the recent merger with Doe Associates has resulted in overlap of some functions. Consequently, it is necessary to reduce our work force in those areas in which we have significant duplication of effort. Effective June 1, the publications and personnel divisions will decrease by 40%. Those affected will be notified by May 15. We sincerely appreciate your contributions and regret that this action has become necessary.I am connecting to you with an apologetic tone for not being able to take up the business proposal that you had sent to Vistashares Inc. It is my pleasure to inform you that you have been selected as the new team leader for development. This significant step on your career path will bring you additional responsibilities, job satisfaction, and financial rewards. Congratulations on your new assignment!It gives me immense pleasure to write to you with regard to the offer of marketing relationship with your company. We want your company to undertake marketing activities right from devising the marketing to implementation of a proper strategy to improve sales. We hope to have a mutually beneficial business relationship with your company. Looking forward to a positive reply from your end.We are pleased to inform you that we have accepted the business proposal sent by you and we are looking forward to work with the best of our business knowledge and potentials. We would like to take this esteem moment to thank you for offering us an opportunity to work with you. In the meantime, it is important to conduct a business meeting so as to discuss the terms and conditions of the business proposal.I am sorry that I will be unable to schedule a time to meet with you next Thursday to discuss your career plans. We are sorry to inform you that we have to terminate our business contractIt is my duty to inform you that our parent company GNU International is instituting a 'no flex-time' policy. As of July 1, we will no longer have this convenience. This letter is in response to your request for weekly progress reports. I will contact you at the beginning of next week to discuss what we still need to accomplish and how we propose to do so.Congratulations on your presentation to our new clients last Friday. The clients seemed especially to appreciate your attention to detail when you answered their questions. Thank you for the preparation you put into this effort. It was one of the best I have attended.I am connecting to you with an apologetic tone for not being able to take up the business proposal that you had sent to Vistashares Inc. Regrettably, recent cutbacks in federally sponsored city arts programs have not left us unscathed. Our grant having been discontinued, we have no alternative but to cease publication of City Artist. This change means the termination of employment for the entire magazine staff of writers, editors, and correspondents, including both full- and part-time employees.I regret that I must cancel our appointment to discuss your athletic clothing line. I have just signed an exclusive distributorship agreement with another company.Due to your unfortunate habit of stealing tools and materials from jobsites, I am firing you, effective immediately. Although we are not taking legal action, you must understand that we have on file the testimonies of several witnesses to your petty thefts, and all have indicated they would be pleased to testify against you in court should the occasion arise. You will receive no severance pay, and I cannot in good faith recommend you to another employer.We hope you will be inspiring us with your innovative thinking for years to come.Please accept my regrets in resigning from my position as Stockroom Manager, effective two weeks from today's date. \n",
